abstract = {The Coleoptera (beetles) exhibits tremendous morphological, ecological, and behavioral diversity. To better understand the phylogenetics and evolution of beetles, we sequenced three complete mitogenomes from two families (Cleridae and Meloidae), which share conserved mitogenomic features with other completely sequenced beetles. We assessed the influence of six datasets and three inference methods on topology and nodal support within the Coleoptera. We found that both Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood with homogeneous-site models were greatly affected by nucleotide compositional heterogeneity, while the heterogeneous-site mixture model in PhyloBayes could provide better phylogenetic signals for the Coleoptera. The amino acid dataset generated more reliable tree topology at the higher taxonomic levels (i.e. suborders and series), where the inclusion of rRNA genes and the third positions of protein-coding genes improved phylogenetic inference at the superfamily level, especially under a heterogeneous-site model. We recovered the suborder relationships as (Archostemata+Adephaga)+(Myxophaga+Polyphaga). The series relationships within Polyphaga were recovered as (Scirtiformia+(Elateriformia+((Bostrichiformia+Scarabaeiformia+Staphyliniformia)+Cucujiformia))). All superfamilies within Cucujiformia were recovered as monophyletic. We obtained a cucujiform phylogeny of (Cleroidea+(Coccinelloidea+((Lymexyloidea+Tenebrionoidea)+(Cucujoidea+(Chrysomeloidea+Curculionoidea))))). This study showed that although tree topologies were sensitive to data types and inference methods, mitogenomic data could provide useful information for resolving the Coleoptera phylogeny at various taxonomic levels by using suitable datasets and heterogeneous-site models.}

abstract = {Abstract Phylogenetic studies of Aleocharinae rove beetles, arguably one of the least known and the largest insect lineages, are compromised by its enormous taxonomic diversity. DNA, a powerful resource for phylogenetics, is not available for numerous extant aleocharine species. We provide a broad comparative morphological study of Aleocharinae to frame molecular datasets for total-evidence analyses. Using full-body dissections and slide-mounting techniques for light microscopy supplemented by scanning electron microscopy, we constructed a morphological matrix across all major taxa focused on non-inquiline tribes of Aleocharinae and outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses of this matrix concatenated with earlier published DNA loci and including exemplar taxa lacking molecular data, resolved outstanding controversies and, among other novelties, showed that: the Habrocerinae + Trichophyinae clade is sister group to Aleocharinae; Hypocyphtini are sister to the rest of the “higher Aleocharinae”; Taxicerini are sister to Aleocharini; Hoplandriini and Placusini are nested within a polyphyletic Oxypodini; Hoplandriini are sister to Meoticina; and Actocharini are nested within Liparocephalini. For the first time, morphological synapomorphies are identified for some large clades of Aleocharinae. In addition, 1252 high-resolution microphotographs of aleocharine structures are made available online with the entire matrix for future research.},

The existence of many scattered objects that should not be clustered has been found to hinder performance of most traditional clustering algorithms in such a high-dimensional complex situation. Very often, additional prior knowledge from databases or previous experiments is also available in the analysis. Excluding scattered objects and incorporating existing prior information are desirable to enhance the clustering performance.Results: In this article, a class of loss functions is proposed for cluster analysis and applied in high-throughput genomic and proteomic data. Two major extensions from K-means are involved: penalization and weighting. The additive penalty term is used to allow a set of scattered objects without being clustered. Weights are introduced to account for prior information of preferred or prohibited cluster patterns to be identified. Their relationship with the classification likelihood of Gaussian mixture models is explored. Incorporation of good prior information is also shown to improve the global optimization issue in clustering. Applications of the proposed method on simulated data as well as high-throughput data sets from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and microarray experiments are presented. Our results demonstrate its superior performance over most existing methods and its computational simplicity and extensibility in the application of large complex biological data sets.Availability:  http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/research/software.htmlContact:  ctseng@pitt.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

A two-step procedure is used. First, the shrinkage distance metric is used in any distance-based clustering method, e.g. K-medoids or hierarchical clustering, to cluster the genes with known functions. Second, while keeping the clustering results from the first step for the genes with known functions, the expression-based distance metric is used to cluster the remaining genes of unknown function, assigning each of them to either one of the clusters obtained in the first step or some new clusters. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction for the yeast demonstrate the advantage of our proposal over the standard method.Contact:  weip@biostat.umn.edu}",

abstract = {Abstract The Asian flea beetles Altica cirsicola, Altica fragariae and Altica viridicyanea are broadly sympatric and morphologically highly similar but feed on distantly related host plants. They have been suggested as a model for ecological speciation studies. However, their phylogeny and species limits remain uncertain. In this study, we added mitochondrial genomes from multiple individuals of each species to the growing database. Phylogenetic analyses based on 15 genes showed clear interspecific divergences of A. fragariae from the other species, but A. cirsicola and A. viridicyanea were not distinguishable by distance-based or tree-based methods of species delimitation due to non-monophyly of mitogenomes relative to the morphologically defined entities, possibly affected by interspecific introgression. This was confirmed by wider sampling of mitochondrial COX1 (58 individuals) and the second internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal RNA cluster (ITS2; 68 individuals), which showed that ITS2, but not COX1, coincided with the morphological species limits. The full mitochondrial genomes are not able to shed further light on the species status, even with the most sensitive approach based on diagnostic characters, yet the whole mitogenome is useful to get improved estimates of intra- and interspecific variation, not affected by the stochastic error seen in individual genes.},

In addition, we show that the use of uncorrected distances yields higher or similar identification success rates for neighbour-joining trees and distance-based identification techniques.

Distances generated under this model then provide the basis for most downstream analyses, but uncertainty in model choice is rarely explored and could potentially affect how reliably DNA barcodes discriminate species. 2. Using information-theoretic approaches for a data set comprising 14 472 DNA barcodes from 14 published studies, we tested whether the K2P model was a good fit at the species level and whether applying a better fitting model biased error rates or changed overall identification success. 3. We report that the K2P was a poorly fitting model at the species level; it was never selected as the best model and very rarely selected as a credible alternative model. Despite the lack of support for the K2P model, differences in distance between best model and K2P model estimates were usually minimal, and importantly, identification success rates were largely unaffected by model choice even when interspecific threshold values were reassessed. 4. Although these conclusions may justify using the K2P model for specimen identification purposes, we found simpler metrics such as p distance performed equally well, perhaps obviating the requirement for model correction in DNA barcoding. Conversely, when incorporating genetic distance data into taxonomic studies, we advocate a more thorough examination of model uncertainty.},

ABSTRACT={<p>Most insect communities are composed of evolutionarily diverse lineages, but detailed phylogenetic analyses of whole communities are lacking, in particular in species-rich tropical faunas. Likewise, our knowledge of the Tree-of-Life to document evolutionary diversity of organisms remains highly incomplete and especially requires the inclusion of unstudied lineages from species-rich ecosystems. Here we present the SITE-100 program, which is an attempt at building the Tree-of-Life from whole-community sampling of high-biodiversity sites around the globe. Combining the local site-based sets into a global tree produces an increasingly comprehensive estimate of organismal phylogeny, while also re-tracing evolutionary history of lineages constituting the local community. Local sets are collected in bulk in standardized passive traps and imaged with large-scale high-resolution cameras, which is followed by a parataxonomy step for the preliminary separation of morphospecies and selection of specimens for phylogenetic analysis. Selected specimens are used for individual DNA extraction and sequencing, usually to sequence mitochondrial genomes. All remaining specimens are bulk extracted and subjected to metabarcoding. Phylogenetic analysis on the mitogenomes produces a reference tree to which short barcode sequences are added in a secondary analysis using phylogenetic placement methods or backbone constrained tree searches. However, the approach may be hampered because (1) mitogenomes are limited in phylogenetic informativeness, and (2) site-based sampling may produce poor taxon coverage which causes challenges for phylogenetic inference. To mitigate these problems, we first assemble nuclear shotgun data from taxonomically chosen lineages to resolve the base of the tree, and add site-based mitogenome and DNA barcode data in three hierarchical steps. We posit that site-based sampling, though not meeting the criterion of “taxon-completeness,” has great merits given preliminary studies showing representativeness and evenness of taxa sampled. We therefore argue in favor of site-based sampling as an unorthodox but logistically efficient way to construct large phylogenetic trees.</p>}}

The performances of FFT‐NS‐2 and FFT‐NS‐i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT‐NS‐2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has dramatically fostered insect mitogenomic research in recent years. However, studies on the insect mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) assembly mainly rely on the sequencing data from total DNA, which is not cost-effective as a huge data from nuclear DNA are wasted. Besides, many mitogenomic studies require genomic information from individual organisms, whereas the DNA yield from small individual insects is too low to meet the sequencing requirements. Here, we describe a strategy for a high enrichment of insect mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique. This strategy consists of standard DNA extraction, RCA enrichment, next-generation sequencing and mitogenome assembly. We have evaluated the performance of this strategy on nine insect species representing eight families of insecta, three other invertebrates, and even two vertebrate specimens. Results show that our strategy is especially suitable for insects, which allows almost all tested insect mtDNA contents to reach 80% and above. A further examination of enrichment efficiency of our strategy among different taxa shows that it is also applicable to other invertebrates and even some vertebrates such as Rhacophorus and ptyas species, although its enrichment efficiency in these groups is lower than that of insects. After treatment with our strategy, small flux sequencing data can realize the assembly of mitogenome with deep coverage, providing a solid base for subsequent mitogenome-based studies.}

    abstract = "{Over the past two decades, there has been a long-standing debate about the impact of taxon sampling on phylogenetic inference. Studies have been based on both real and simulated data sets, within actual and theoretical contexts, and using different inference methods, to study the impact of taxon sampling. In some cases, conflicting conclusions have been drawn for the same data set. The main questions explored in studies to date have been about the effects of using sparse data, adding new taxa, including more characters from genome sequences and using different (or concatenated) locus regions. These questions can be reduced to more fundamental ones about the assessment of data quality and the design guidelines of taxon sampling in phylogenetic inference experiments. This review summarizes progress to date in understanding the impact of taxon sampling on the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis.}",
